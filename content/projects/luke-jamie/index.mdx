Luke Jamie Apparel was a high-end British men's apparel store. The project was
started by a friend of mine, who wanted to release designer clothes with a regal
theme. Unfortunately, the project was cancelled before it launched.

The following page documents an incomplete project. So some designs may be
underdeveloped or awkward.
