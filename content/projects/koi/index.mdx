Koi was a desktop document editor, that aimed to provide a more elegant,
intuitive editing experience. It was ultimately suspended due to scope issues
and growing complexity, but it's definitely a project I'd like to revisit some
day.

I managed to design the entire interface, and a custom document format called
KDF, based on JSON instead of XML.
