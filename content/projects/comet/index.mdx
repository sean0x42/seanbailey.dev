Comet was a private instant messaging service that I designed and developed over
the course of a year for my Year 12 Major Design Project (MDP). Facebook
Messenger was widely used accross my high school campus, but few students were
really aware of the highly invasive practices employed by Facebook. My aim was
to start a discussion amongst students about our privacy online, and develop an
alternative platform that emphasized privacy and security.

The messenger home page was my first deep dive into building a product page.
It may not look like much, but I spent many, many hours painstakingly
peicing this together by hand.

## Responsive Design

Comet was also my first time developing a fully responsive website. I knew that
many people would want to use an instant messaging service on their phone, so
supporting all screen sizes was a must.
