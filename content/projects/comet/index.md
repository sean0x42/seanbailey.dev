Comet was my final year Major Design Project (MDP). I successfully designed and
developed an instant messaging service, with the goal of being a privacy focused
alternative to Facebook messenger.

The project contained a lot of firsts for me. It was my first time designing a
logo, designing an interface, and building a website with backend. The end
product was ultimately not high enough quality to release to the world, but
Comet proved to be a fantastic experience none-the-less.
