Earlier this month, I had the priviledge of recording a quick 10 minute dev
update with the wonderful people at NewyTechPeople. [Liam][liam] asked me all
about my portfolio, and my experience as a developer living and working in
Newcastle.

You can watch the full video with show notes on the [NewyTechPeople
website][episode].

Thanks so much to everyone at Newy Tech People for having me on, and thanks to
you for watching!
