<!-- @format -->

If you are new to digital design, you may find yourself making frequent use of
the ever popular hexadecimal notation: `#FFFFFF`. Hex may be the coolest kid on
the block, but there's another format that is infinitely more intuitive. Today
I'd like to introduce you to HSL, a colour format which will change the way you
compose colours, and help you get a grasp on colour theory at the same time.
Win-win!
