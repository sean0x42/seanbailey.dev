Earlier this year I made the difficult decision to kill off a side project.
Failing on a side project is never wasted time, unless you fail to reflect on
the mistakes that you made along the way. So with that said, I'd like to take a
moment to reflect on that project and hopefully in doing so, we can all learn
something from my flaming wreckage.

# Here's how it happened

I decided to design a document editor. One that ignores decades of convention
and tradition, and instead focuses on providing a simple, enjoyable experience.
Sounds simple enough right?

- Designing and half writing a custom document specification
- Supporting existing document formats. Reading through literally thousands of
  pages of the ODT and DOCX specifications.
- Preparing for collaborative document editing by building a CRDT compatible
  editing history module.
- Designing a product page
- Designing a high-fidelity interface prototype in Adobe XD
- Creating a custom clipboard history stack implementation
- And that's just the things we finished over that period, we had so many more
  ideas.

Here's the thing about reimagining something that's been around for decades:
**you have to reinvent some wheels**. For example: you can't just reuse an
existing document format like `.docx` or `.odt`, because those formats were
designed to support the exact structure your attempting to avoid. So now you're
also going to need your very own document format. It should probably also have a
specification so that others can write parsers and contribute additional
features. And so I spent a few months doing exactly that...

But wait a second! You can't just build your own document format. You need to
support the existing document formats, or else no one will ever want to use your
product, right? At the _least_ we'll need to support `.docx` files given their
popularity. So after making this realisation, I read through a 5,000 page document format
specification, supporting as many features described as possible. And so a few
more months go by...

Whew, thank god that's done! The hard part must surely be over now. Right? Well
we haven't actually started working on the document renderer yet. That's right,
the thing that's responsible for rendering a custom document format consistently
accross different operating systems hasn't been built yet. Ahh no worries, time
to get to work. And once again, a months fly by...

<Figure caption="Wow. Things are going great!">

And now things are _sort of_ coming together. You've started having nightmares
about text wrapping algorithms, but try not to let that get to you. Soon you'll
be able to start implementing some of those great features you thought of! Wait
a minute... what about:

- Document templates
- Colour palettes
- Editor themes
- Online collaboration
- A product page
- A feedback form in the app
- Social media accounts
- Spelling and grammar checks? Why am I only thinking of this now!
- Ooh! Maybe a _design checker_ that reviews the design of your document?
- ...
-
- Oh no...


# So what went wrong?

Well two things actually. Firstly, I failed to prototype enough. If I spent more
time prototyping early on, I could have avoided the 18+ month development time
that followed. I would have realised sooner just how challenging and resource
intensive a project of this scope and nature would be. I would have **failed
faster**, and then adapted the idea or moved on to a different, more viable
project.

Secondly, and perhaps the greatest sin of all, **I failed to keep things
simple**. When you're working on an idea that you're passionate about it's
really easy to get lost in the details. Before you know it, you're fleshing
things out in all different directions and you've totally lost focus of the
original problem.

Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson said it best in their excellent book
[Rework][rework]:

> ...Details make the difference. But getting infatuated with details too early
> leads to disagreement, meetings, and delays. You get lost in the things that

> anyway. So ignore the details—for a while. Nail the basics first and worry

So if there's anything to take away from this project let it be this: keep it
simple, prototype everything, and fail faster.
