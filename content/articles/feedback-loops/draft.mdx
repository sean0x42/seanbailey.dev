#### Notes

This is quite a broad article. Perhaps there is a way I could break it out into
several smaller articles.

- Attach your passion to the problem not the solution. Misplaced passion kills
  projects.
- Build feedback loops to get projects done faster with greater quality.

When I was [a guest on the NewTechPeople podcast][podcast] earlier this year,
Liam asked me a brilliant question:

[podcast]: https://www.seanbailey.dev/articles/look-mum-newy-tech-people

> So, I've found that a lot of graduates that I talk to, they may have started
> projects—the operative word being started—there's not a lot of finishing of
> projects. [...] Have you had any sort of battles with motivation to really get
> projects across the line? What sort of strategies have you used to try and
> help there?

At the time, I was surprised by the question, and answered something along the
lines of: "you need to believe in your idea" and "be willing to throw things
away". I've since been thinking about that question quite a bit, and I've
managed to narrow the general idea down into its essence: If you're going to
build something to solve a real problem in your life, what steps can you take to
increase the chance of building a successful, valuable product?

# Step 1: Attach Your Passion to the Problem

I see a lot of less experienced developers, myself included, view building
products as a game of determination. There's this belief that: when you first
pick up a problem, you need to choose a solution and invest time in that
solution until you're finished.

But this kind of attitude is very short sighted. Very few people ever pick a
good problem at first, and even fewer pick a good solution.

A certain amount of agility is required: I have this problem, I'm going to start
experimenting with solutions and adapt based on the things I learn along the
way.

There also needs to be a willingness to accept failure early on. To be willing
to accept that this problem is too hard, too time consuming, or just not that
important to you anymore. If you apply determination to these kinds of problems,
you'll just end up wasting time.

- And because of that, failure will happen. You will try solutions that don't
  work, and you will have ideas that are utlimately discarded.
- The only way to finish something, is to focus on the problem, and experiment
  and iterate until a great solution begins to present itself. And the only way to know
  that something is great, is to put it in front of real people and get
  feedback.

# Step 2: Build Feedback Loops

- ...And the only way to know
  that something is great, is to put it in front of real people and get
  feedback.

- The sooner in the creative process you can get feedback, the sooner you can
  get rid of the crap that doesn't belong. Like a phoenix, which spontaneously
  combusts into ash, and is reborn into something greater.
