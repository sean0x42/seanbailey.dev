When I was first learning to write code, I remember having this incredible
realisationâ€”once you know how to program, **you can build anything** you can
possibly imagine. Websites, databases, mobile apps, video games. You name it,
and with enough time and determination you can build it!

But there is a downside to the immense freedom and power we have as programmers:
it's incredibly easy to pick up new projects, even when you've yet to finish the
last one. You end up accumulating projects over time, promising to work on
various things for different people in your life.

Like many young developers, I imagine, I've always thought that the best way to
build something from start to finish, was through shear hard work and
determination. I believed that if you pushed through the challenges, endured the
pain, you would eventually emerge on the other side of your labours victorious.

After all, hard work pays off massively in other areas of life, so why wouldn't
that approach work for product development too? When working this way, I have
found some success. If you can endure and stick it out to the end, great
products can be made. But more often than not, things get left behind in a half
completed pile after a number of weeks or even months.

The other danger of this approach is **burn out**. Which can have some serious
ramifications on your personal life, including the breakdown of relationships
and a deteriation of your mental health.

It's naive to think that one (or a few) people could possibly design an entire
product. In the best case scenario, you may do a great job of 90% of it, but if
you bring in other people to criticise your work and offer new ideas and
perspectives, the final product will be much better.

1. An approach of hard work and determination
   1. Working this way has found some success. I've finished a few projects this way.
   2. Hard work pays off in other ways in life, so why wouldn't it in product
      development also?
   3. Burn out is a real danger, and can have some seriousn ramifications on
      your personal life, including the breakdown of relationships and
      deteriation of your mental health.
   4. It's naive to think that one (or a few) people could possibly design an entire
      product. In the best case scenario, you may do a great job of 90% of it,
      but if you bring in other people to criticise your work and offer new
      ideas and perspectives, the final product will be much better.

# Introducing Feedback Loops

2. In addition to some hard work and determination, we should build feedback
   loops to receive constant course correction and motivation throughout development.
   Some hard work is still required, but here we are aiming for the mantra of "work
   smarter not harder".
   1. It's a long slog building anything, so having constant motivation is
      imperitive. Putting your product in front of other people, and hearing their
      interest or curiosity. Of course, this has a second added benefit of being
      almost like a litmus test for your solution. If people don't care, maybe
      the problem isn't worth solving. Or alternatively, maybe you just haven't
      found the right solution to that problem just yet. So when you put your
      half made solution in front of people and get a passionate response, you
      not only get a little extra dopamine to continue progress moving forward,
      you also get reassurance that you might be on the right track.
   2. There's a few ways to achieve this: you could show your prototypes to real
      people, and see how they interact with and use it. You could also do what
      I'm going to start doing: sharing your progress with strangers on the
      internet. Starting early next year, my goal is to post monthly product
      updates on something I've been working on! By enforcing a monthly
      schedule, the longest a feedback cycle could possibly take is 4 weeks.
      Long enough in my opinion to get some interesting work done, but short
      enough that I'm never really venturing too far from the eyes of others.

Up until recently, I've had a fairly simple strategy for completing projects: pick
a meaningful problem, push through any challenges, endure the pain, and emerge
victorious from your labours. But this kind of approach to product development -
determination at all costs - is incredibly naive. More often that not, you end up driving
projects into the ground, burning out, and damaging your personal life in the process.
I know I've fallen prey to this scenario on a number of different occasions.

With product development, determination actually leads you to an early demise.
After a few weeks, or maybe months, you burn out and your project is left behind
and forgotten.

Sunk cost fallacy and pride. "I can't stop now, this project has some merrit, it
would be amazing if I could just finish it."

Another related, but different problem, is that we often bite off much more than
we can chew, and so when we combine a giant appetite with unruly determination,
we get one giant waste of time. That was my problem for a number of years
anyway.

So how do you overcome this? We have to work smarter, not harder. We have to
build feedback loops. Every time you do some work, you show that work to your
friends, family, or random strangers online. You don't give them any lead up,
you just show them your half baked project, warts and all, and then you listen
carefully to what they have to say. Sometimes people will spot mistakes, or
provide suggestons and ideas that you hadn't previously thought of. But most
importantly of all, you will generate interest. And having people interested in
your project as it develops will make you infinitely more motivated.

- From here on out, you need to bring real people into the process, preferably
  people that aren't afraid to tell you the honest cold truth.

You need to create a cycle, where whatever you're working on at any given time
offers some value, more than just "for the greater good". It provides
immediate value, that encourages you to move onto the next stage, and also
enables you to adapt to any criticisms or feedback.

When a product is still in development, you have to be agile and willing to
adapt. And remember, a project is never truly done:

Thanks to Liam Potter for putting this question in my mind. I've been thinking
a lot about producitivity recently, and trying to figure out the best way to get
things done.
