I was recently pairing with a UX designer at [nib][nib], and I was blown away by
how quickly he threw a concept together. I was witnessing an experienced,
talented designer, explore an interface design by quickly drawing some
rectangles on the screen and calling it a day.

ðŸ¤¯

If I were in his shoes, I would have spent hours perfecting the design. Tweaking
saturation, adjusting border radii, and lining up pixels. I would have hidden
myself somewhere quiet, thrown on my best playlist, and toiled away until the
result was breathtaking.

The reality, however, is that his quick sketches where enough to communicate the
problem and the solution. He didn't need to spend hours perfecting his concept,
because it was exactly thatâ€”a concept. He also managed to get feedback much
sooner in the creative cycle. Five minutes with some shape and text tools and he
was ready to hear and incorporate some opinions.

Another factor to consider here, is that **feedback always rocks the boat**. If
you spend hours on a design, and someone comes in with a better suggestion, you
better believe those hours were all for nothing.

According to the [Pareto principle][pareto], the first 20% of the work we do is
enough to produce 80% of the value. Often times, especially when working with
concepts and prototypes, this is more than enough! Beyond this point we enter
the domain of diminishing returns. Beyond this point, the only person that
benefits from your hard work on a prototype is _you_.

So ask yourself: is it worth chasing perfection? I say: **focus on communicating
ideas instead of perfection**. When we do we move faster, achieve more, and
prevent ourselves from investing many hours into an idea that's going nowhere.
