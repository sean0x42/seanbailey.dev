1. Document editors play a vital role in everyday computing. Enabling us to
   build documents and convey information easily to others.
   1. I think they're in desperate need of a rethink. They've become bloated
      and sluggish, and I often find that the tool itself gets in my way when
      I'm trying to compose documents.
   2. I'd love for there to be a rethink of how we approach building document
      editors, and by extension how we build documents.
   3. I won't spend much more time explaining my position on document editors,
      at risk of sounding preachy and overstating the weight of the problem. So
      let's dive in and explore something I've been working on for a while now.
2. Introducing component based document editing
   1. I'm proposing an alternative way of composing documents: building them
      peice by peice with components.
   2. I believe that building documents in this way is more intuitive for the
      end user, and would enable complex document layouts through component
      composition. **i.e. simple and intuitive**
   3. By building an editor in this way, it would be trivial to add new
      components as time goes on, and allow document authors to further enhance
      their documents with new components. **i.e. potential for long term growth.**
   4. With components, you have more control over your document's content. Not
      only can you delete and add text, but you could also add new components,
      move components, delete subtrees, etc. **i.e. power**
   - You build a document from components. You create complex layouts and
     components by combinding and configuring a number of smaller components.

# An Industry Primed for a Shake Up

- In 2020, editing a document is not a great experience
  - If you've got a bit of money, and not much computer experience (find a nicer
    way of saying this) you will probably look to Microsoft Word. Here you will
    find bloat, complexity, and an editing experience that has not really been
    questioned in decades. Word is not explicitly bad, but it is far from
    ideal.
  - If you need collaboration, you'll turn to Google Docs. But Google Docs is
    not all that different to word, with poorer performance in my opinion.

If you're serious about composing the document, particularly in an academic
environement, you may turn to LaTeX or another markup language. But installing
the toolchain for LaTeX can sometimes be nightmarish, and LaTeX is not very
welcoming to visual people (it's great however if you're a nerd like me).

So maybe it's about time we start questioning the core of the problem: and look
toward the editing experience itself. Is there another way we can compose
documents? A different approach that is more intuitive, more expressive, and
more powerful. I think the problem with Word, Google Docs, and other visual
document editors, is that no matter how much you polish them they are still
built on outdated foundations. What if we could approach the problem with
a new foundation?

# Introducing: Component Based Documents

- I'm building a document editor. This is really my second attempt, after
  designing and building one at university, I have learnt a lot from the
  experience and I know now where the major challenges lie.
  - Aiming for simplicity.
  - An editing experience that is radically different to that of Word or Google
    Docs.

# NEXT ARTICLE

- Considering the new component insert button
  - Goal: extremely lightweight. Editors will open this menu many times over
    whilst editing a document, so the more streamlined the better.
  - Goal: extensible. In future it would be great to add animations and
    additional information beside a particular selection
  - Goal: a hub for discovery. This menu should show all components, meaning
    anything you can add to a document can be found here.
- Considering text selection in a component world
  - Need to do an A/B test to determine which route is best. Show findings here
    in this article.
