Rust is a brilliant language, offering a rather unique combination of
performance, safety, and a great community. But for many new comers, Rust is
also a daunting challenge. The language has a far steeper learning curve than
say JavaScript or Ruby. But as someone who recently overcame that learning
curve, I can confidently say that it's not as challenging as it may look from
the outside.

> **Note**: This article assumes some knowledge of programming outside of Rust.
> Skills you've learnt in other languages will transfer well, and make your
> experience quite a bit smoother. If you're completely new to programming, I
> suggest you learn some generic programming concepts first.

## Start with the Book

The Rust book is a brilliant resource, written by the members of the Rust core
team. It covers just about every topic you can imagine, and outlines the
motivation behind Rust's many design decisions. Don't stress about reading every
word of every chapter. Just make sure you understand Rust's core
conceptsâ€”especially **ownership and borrowing**.

## Learn to Love the Compiler

Rust solves a whole class of problems for you thanks to its strict compiler.
This compiler will be your greatest friend when you understand the concepts
underlying the language, but is a huge barrier to entry for beginners. At
times, it feels like the compiler complains about everything you do. Then, as
your code gets closer and closer to the happy path, the less the compiler
complains and the better your code is.

## Expect to be Challenged

Like any language, Rust will challenge your existing notions, approaches, and
patterns. But in my career so far, I've yet to encounter a language that has
challenged my quite as much as Rust has.

## Love the Little Things

-   Rust has a powerful module/crate system. Leverage it to organise your code,
    and prevent any one thing from growing to large, too quickly.

-   Rust is a great language that introduces a bunch of great paradigms. The enums
    in Rust are a real joy to work with, and I love that I can write my own macros
    that
