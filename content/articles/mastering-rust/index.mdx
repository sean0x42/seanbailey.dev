Rust is a great language! But learning it can be difficult. This article will
provide some advice for future Rustaceans facing down a steep learning curve. If
you're guided through the process it's 10 times easier.

Things to explore

- Like any language, Rust will challenge your existing notions, approaches, and
  patterns. But in my career so far, I've yet to encounter a language that has
  challenged my quite as much as Rust has.

- Rust solves a whole class of problems for you thanks to its strict compiler.
  This compiler will be your greatest friend when you understand the concepts
  underlying the language, but is a huge barrier to entry for beginners. At
  times, it feels like the compiler complains about everything you do. Then, as
  your code gets closer and closer to the happy path, the less the compiler
  complains and the better your code is.

- Rust has a powerful module/crate system. Leverage it to organise your code,
  and prevent any one thing from growing to large, too quickly.

- Rust is a great language that introduces a bunch of great paradigms. The enums
  in Rust are a real joy to work with, and I love that I can write my own macros
  that 

```rust
/// This is a doc string
fn hello_world(request: Request, _state: &State) -> Response {
    // This is a comment
    json_response!(request, "Hello, world!")
}
```

```typescript
import { style } from 'treat'

export const image = style(theme => ({
  // Box model
  marginBottom: '5rem',

  // Visuals
  backgroundColor: theme.grey80,
  borderRadius: '3px',
}))
```
