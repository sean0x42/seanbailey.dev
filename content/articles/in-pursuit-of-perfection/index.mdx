I was recently pairing with a UX designer at [nib][nib], and I was blown away by
how quickly he threw a concept together. I was witnessing an experienced,
talented designer, explore an interface design by quickly drawing some
rectangles on the screen and calling it a day.

ðŸ¤¯

If I were in his shoes, I would have spent hours perfecting the design. Tweaking
saturation, adjusting border radiuses[^1], and lining up pixels. The result
would be amazing! But the moment I showed someone for feedback, a single
suggestion would suddenly render hours of effort pointless.

[^1]: Apparently both _radiuses_ and _radii_ are [valid plurals][radii] for radius.

The reality is that his quick sketches where enough to communicate the problem
and the solution. He didn't need to spend hours perfecting his concept,
because it was exactly thatâ€”a concept. He also managed to get feedback much
sooner in the creative cycle. Five minutes with some shape and text tools and he
was ready to hear and incorporate some opinions.

According to the [Pareto principle][pareto], the first 20% of the work we do is
enough to produce 80% of the value. Often times, especially when working
with concepts, this is more than enough! Beyond this point we enter the domain
of _diminishing returns_. Beyond this point, the only person that benefits from
your labour is _you_.

So ask yourself: is it worth chasing perfection? I say: **focus on excellence
over perfection**, because when we do we can move faster, achieve more, and stop
ourselves sooner from investing in a bad idea.
