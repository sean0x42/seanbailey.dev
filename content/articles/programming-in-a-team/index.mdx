- The first time I have ever programmed in a serious team environment was at
  nib.
- Of course I've dabbled in team work plenty of times before, doing group
  assignments at university, organising and working on side projects with some friends.
- But up until May of this year, I had never been actively writing code that a team of other full time developers was also working on. Prior to this, I had been programming solo for roughly 4 years.
- That's roughly 4 years of habits that suddenly needed to be questioned. And don't get me wrong, fortunately for me I had taken it upon myself to make the most of good team practices early on, so it could definitely have been a more challenging process.

Previously, whilst being guided by senior software developer and all round great guy Josh Peak, I learnt the following statement:

> When you write code, you're writing for two different audiences. The computer, and whoever comes along to work on that code later. And that person might just be you.

## Writing helpful comit messages

I was not doing a great job. Fix this. Try something. Blah. After starting at nib, I really needed to start writing great commit messages. The lead developer in my squad, Sean Wisely, gave the following words of wisdom:

The commit message should be what changed. The body should be the why. And for convenience, put the branch name/Jira ticket at the bottom.

```
Change title size to 16px

The title was previously too large, and on the advice of our UX
designer, I have reduced its size from 22px to just 16px.

## Writing fewer comments

That's correct. *Fewer*. I love to write, as you may have guessed from my blog, and as a result I was documenting the living hell out of all the code I was writing. It would take me ages to make even a small amount of code. The problem is that my team at nib didn't share this same passion for writing comments. In fact, they had the attitude of comments are apologies. That code should be so readable that it documents itself. Thanks Klee and Sean W.

So I really had to overcome my years of habit, and try to see the problem from someone else's perspective. Which is really hard when I had been told nonstop by the internet and my university that everything must be commented. This was a pretty wild realisation, as suddenly I could question some things I had in my mind as a: simple do and don't question it. 

## Avoid the sledge hammer method (work in progess)

This is a habit I'm still working to kick. But when you're working on a project on your own, with no one looking over your shoulder, it's really tempting to just tear out huge chunks of code that aren't perfect. 

Say you're changing a React component as part of a task, and you notice it's parent is a bit messy and could use some cleaning up. My instinct is to head up there and clean things up for me. I hate messy code. But to be a coherent member of a team, sometimes you have to let sleeping dogs lie. Sometimes you have to accept that thigns aren't perfect, and avoid opening the pandoras box, and just perform the task that you came here to do.

That is really, really hard though. So I'll admit I still need to do a lot of work here. It's hard to resist the urge to hammer a nail.

## Pairing is powerful

And with great power comes great responsibility. You have to balance the amount that you pair, so that you don't get exhausted, you don't piss off your coworkers with constant pairing and prevent them from doing their work, but also so you don't get blocked when pairing could help you out.
